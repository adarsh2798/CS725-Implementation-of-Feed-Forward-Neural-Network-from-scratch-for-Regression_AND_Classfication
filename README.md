# Implementation-of-Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-from-scratch-for-Regression-task

This project was done as a part of CS725 course at IIT Bombay. Here, I have implemented a Feed-Forward Neural Netwrok from scartch in python for a regression task. The netwrok was trained on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs725-2022-assignment-regression/data).

The task was to predict the release year of songs (years ranging 1922-2011) based on timbre-based audio features.

A kaggle task was hosted [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs725-2022-assignment-regression).

The link to kaggle's private leaderboard is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs725-2022-assignment-regression/leaderboard), where I got a score of 10.84250 and rank 27.
