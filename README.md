# CS725--Implementation-of-Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-from-scratch-for-Regression-task

## This project was done as a part of CS725 course at IIT Bombay. 

# 1. Regression
Here, I have implemented a Feed-Forward Neural Netwrok from scartch in python for a regression task. The netwrok was trained on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs725-2022-assignment-regression/data).

The task was to predict the release year of songs (years ranging 1922-2011) based on timbre-based audio features. The newtrok was optimized by implementing ADAM optimizer and to capture the main features of dataset, PCA was implemenetd.

A kaggle task was hosted [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs725-2022-assignment-regression).

The link to kaggle's private leaderboard is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs725-2022-assignment-regression/leaderboard), where I got a score of 10.84250 and rank 27.

The codes can be found in the [folder](https://github.com/adarsh2798/Implementation-of-Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-from-scratch-for-Regression-task/tree/main/21307R001(1)/21307R001)

# 2. Classification

Here, I have implemeneted a neural netwrok from scratch for claasifying songs as ("Very Old", "Old", "New" and "Recent").
Used sigmoid activation with 4 neurons in output layer. Trained the network and evaluated the network on validation data.
